# Hypothyroidism_prediction
A model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## Introduction
Hypothyroidism is a common condition where the thyroid doesn’t create and release enough thyroid hormone into your bloodstream. This makes your metabolism slow down. Also called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism can make you feel tired, gain weight and be unable to tolerate cold temperatures. Hypothyroidism can have a primary cause or a secondary cause. A primary cause is a condition that directly impacts the thyroid and causes it to create low levels of thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)). A secondary cause is something that causes the pituitary gland to fail, which means it can’t send thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to the thyroid to balance out the thyroid hormones.

Primary causes of hypothyroidism are much more common. The most common of these primary causes is an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto’s disease. Also called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, this condition is hereditary (passed down through a family). In Hashimoto’s disease, the body’s immune system attacks and damages the thyroid. This prevents the thyroid from making and releasing enough thyroid hormone.

The other primary causes of hypothyroidism can include:

Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid); Treatment of hyperthyroidism (radiation and surgical removal of the thyroid); Iodine deficiency (not having enough iodine — a mineral your thyroid uses to make hormones – in your body); Hereditary conditions (a medical condition passed down through your family).

### Problem Statement
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. As the data scientist my objective is to use the healthcare datasets provided to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

### Objective
Determining the different indicators of hypothyroidism

### Metrics of success
Read and explore the given dataset.

Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Performing univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.

Performing SVm and Decision tree models and choosing the best model with the highest accuracy rate above 90%.

Providing recommendation based the analysis.

Challenge the solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements in model improvement.
